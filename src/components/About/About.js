        My journey into the world of technology began with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communications from the esteemed Indian Institute of Information Technology Nagpur (IIIT-N). Throughout my undergraduate studies, I developed a strong foundation in electronics principles, telecommunications, and signal processing. While my background provided valuable insights into hardware systems, I transitioned to computer science for my master's studies driven by a desire to explore new horizons and embrace emerging technologies. I recognized the transformative impact of software-driven innovation and the opportunities it presented to address complex challenges across diverse domains. This transition was fueled by my innate curiosity, coupled with a passion for technology and a relentless pursuit of knowledge.
